# Mutex Policy

This repository contains the code for our team's project,
as part of the Operating Systems course at FMI UniBuc.

## Building

The project is primarily written in Python.

## Installing ZeroMQ

The code relies on the [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) messaging library
for inter-process communication.

To install the ZeroMQ bindings for Python do:
```sh
pip3 install pyzmq
```
